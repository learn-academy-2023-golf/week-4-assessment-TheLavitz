# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the virtual DOM in React?

Your answer: React creates and maintains a copy of the DOM that is can monitor and update and only pushes changes out to the DOM when necessary.

Researched answer: An in-memory representation of the real DOM. React watches the virtual DOM for changes, reconciles those with the real DOM and groups those changes together into batches that update the Real DOM as efficiently as possible.

2. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: When a method is written in Ruby, if it does not include a return then the last line of the method is returned.

Researched answer: The last evaluated expression in a method is what is returned if there isn't an explicit return.

3. Compare and contrast JavaScript and Ruby. What are three things they have in common and what are three differences?

Your answer: JavaScript and Ruby are both capable of conditionals like if, they can hold data in variables, and they can generate objects from classes. Differences include things like "else if" vs elsif, Ruby's implicit returns, and Ruby's lack of curly braces.

Researched answer: Ruby and JavaScript are both considered high-level, meaning that they use abstractions to make themselves more readable. They are also interpreted and dynamically typed. While JavaScript is primarily client-side, Ruby is mostly used server-side. Ruby is also focused more on human-readability and concurrency.

4. STRETCH: What is a version manager?

Your answer: A tool that monitors software and ensures that files stay up-to-date.

Researched answer: A version manager give you the ability to switch between multiple versions of a piece of software to maintain compatibility accross multiple projects.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Ruby blocks: Chunks of code wrapped in 'do...end'

2. RSpec: A testing framework like Jest was for JavaScript.

3. Test-driven development: Write tests describing what you want your code to do and then write the code so that the test passes.
