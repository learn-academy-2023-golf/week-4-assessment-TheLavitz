# ASSESSMENT 4: Behavioral Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. Use the Nugget + STAR method for each answer.

1. Why did you choose a career in software development?

- Nugget: I have been working with computers in some capacity for most of my life and, especially over the last few years, I have recognized that the time I spend working out problems at my keyboard is far more rewarding than many other aspects of my work.

- Situation: When my contract was suddenly cut short due to budget constraints I was faced with a need to find work, but through thoughtful planning ahead of time I was also given a window of time in which I could research my options and pick my next transition carefully

- Task: I needed to find work, but I didn't necessarily need to find work immediately and I was encouraged by my loved ones to take my time and pick my next steps thoughtfully.

- Action: I submitted applications for and interviewed with various companies, but I also looked into what options the were made available to me through the VA after my military service and upon discovering a training program that would give me the time and skills necesarry to move into the industry I began to orient myself towards that goal.

- Result: I am currently attending a 16-week coding bootcamp through LEARN Academy and excitedly absorbing all of the material provided to me in hopes of starting work in software development as soon as possible.

2. In previous roles, how have you helped teammates succeed?

- Nugget: As a member of the pre-commissioning crew for USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000) I helped develop training material to familiarize the crew with new ship systems that were being developed for installation onboard.

- Situation: After being selected for a postion on the pre-comissioning crew of the USS Zumwalt I was informed that the sonar system that would be installed was a newly developed system and as such the specifications would not match anything in our current training material.

- Task: Collect, sort, and analyze multiple years-worth of documentation in order to develop more concise descriptions of the equipment that the AN/SQQ-90 sonar system would be comprised of.

- Action: I quickly recognized as I was sorting through the documentation made available to me that there was no organizational method to where the documents were being stored digitally or how the files were titled. I developed a list of key terms and phrases that were most likely to show up in documentation relevant to my task so that I could identify which documents I needed to focus on. I then needed to verify the accuracy of the documentation by making sure that information provided by one document had not ben superseded by another, more recent, document. Finally, I was able to conolidate the information I collected into two PowerPoint presentations that could be presented to the crew (containing more general information) and to my division (containing much more in-depth descriptions and explanations.)

- Result: These presentations were able to provide a level of knowledge to the entire crew that helped them prepare for ship's comissioning as well as identify more specific areas my division and department would need to focus on and even helped identify mistakes that had been made leading up to incorrect dimensions being provided for the installation of certain equipment onboard.
